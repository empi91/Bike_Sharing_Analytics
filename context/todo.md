**Stack:** FastAPI + Supabase + Vanilla JavaScript

---

## Now (Today - Sept 3, remaining ~16 hours)

### Project Setup & Foundation
- [ ] Create GitHub repository `bike-station-reliability` 
- [ ] Set up Python project structure with `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Install core dependencies: `FastAPI[all]`, `supabase`, `requests`, `pytest`, `python-dotenv`, `apscheduler`
- [ ] Create Supabase project and get API keys (free tier is perfect for MVP)
- [ ] Set up `.env` file with Supabase credentials and configuration
- [ ] Set up basic FastAPI application with health check endpoint (`/api/health`)

### Database Foundation (Supabase)
- [ ] Create Supabase database tables using SQL editor or Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Set up all 4 tables: `bike_stations`, `availability_snapshots`, `reliability_scores`, `api_sync_logs`
- [ ] Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies for future scalability
- [ ] Test Supabase Python client connection and basic CRUD operations
- [ ] Create Pydantic models matching Supabase schema
- [ ] Test database connection and basic queries from FastAPI

### Initial API Setup
- [ ] Create FastAPI app structure with routers (`/api/stations/`, `/api/internal/`)
- [ ] Implement basic error handling and response models
- [ ] Set up environment configuration for different stages (dev/prod)

## This Week (Sept 3-8)

### Core Backend Development
- [ ] Research target city bike API - recommend **General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS)** 
  - NYC Citi Bike: https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/gbfs.json
  - DC Capital Bikeshare: https://gbfs.capitalbikeshare.com/gbfs/gbfs.json
  - Choose one major city for MVP
- [ ] Build bike API client class with error handling, rate limiting, and async support
- [ ] Implement station data fetching and initial Supabase seeding
- [ ] Create availability snapshot collection function with Supabase batch inserts
- [ ] Write reliability score calculation algorithm (30-day rolling window using Supabase database functions)
- [ ] Build background task scheduler using `APScheduler` for 5-minute intervals

### API Endpoints (MVP Core)
- [ ] Implement `GET /api/stations/nearby` with address geocoding 
  - Use **Nominatim** (OpenStreetMap) - free, no API key required
  - Integrate with Supabase PostGIS for distance calculations
- [ ] Build `GET /api/stations/{station_id}` endpoint
- [ ] Create `GET /api/stations/{station_id}/reliability` with hourly timeline data
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Implement Pydantic models for request/response validation
- [ ] Add API key authentication for internal endpoints

### Simple Frontend (Vanilla JS - No Framework)
- [ ] Create simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend (single page application)
- [ ] Build responsive address search form with autocomplete
- [ ] Display nearest stations list with reliability scores and distances
- [ ] Create station detail modal/page with timeline visualization
- [ ] Add weekday/weekend toggle functionality
- [ ] Implement loading states and error handling in UI
- [ ] Make mobile-responsive using CSS Grid/Flexbox

### Essential Testing & Validation
- [ ] Write unit tests for reliability calculation algorithm
- [ ] Test all API endpoints with mock and real data
- [ ] Test Supabase operations and data integrity
- [ ] Manual end-to-end testing of complete user flow
- [ ] Test with real city API data and validate calculations

## Next Week (Sept 9-15)

### System Reliability & Data Quality
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging using Python `logging` module with structured output
- [ ] Implement data validation and error recovery for API sync failures
- [ ] Create simple admin dashboard using Supabase dashboard or custom FastAPI endpoints
- [ ] Handle edge cases: station offline, API downtime, rate limiting, network failures
- [ ] Add health check monitoring for background tasks
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for external API calls

### Frontend Polish & User Experience
- [ ] Improve UI styling with modern CSS (CSS variables, transitions)
- [ ] Add loading spinners and skeleton screens
- [ ] Create simple charts for reliability timeline using **Chart.js** or **D3.js**
- [ ] Add station distance calculation and estimated walking time
- [ ] Implement search history and favorite stations (localStorage)
- [ ] Add tooltips and help text for reliability scores
- [ ] Optimize for mobile viewing and touch interactions

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Set up production Supabase project with proper security
- [ ] Configure FastAPI for production with Gunicorn/Uvicorn
- [ ] Create Docker configuration for easy deployment
- [ ] Set up environment variables and secrets management
- [ ] Choose deployment platform (Render, Railway, or Vercel for static frontend)
- [ ] Create simple monitoring using Supabase dashboard and custom metrics

### Deployment & Launch Preparation
- [ ] Test complete system with 7+ days of accumulated historical data
- [ ] Verify reliability calculations are mathematically sound
- [ ] Conduct user testing with 3-5 potential users
- [ ] Create simple documentation and help text
- [ ] Set up custom domain and SSL
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Monitor initial launch performance and fix critical issues

## Technical Architecture Benefits

### Why FastAPI + Supabase?

**FastAPI Advantages:**
- ‚ö° **High Performance**: Built on Starlette and Pydantic, crucial for 3-second response requirement
- üîÑ **Async Support**: Perfect for concurrent API calls to city bike services
- üìö **Auto Documentation**: Swagger UI at `/docs` for easy API testing
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Pydantic models catch errors at development time
- üöÄ **Fast Development**: Less boilerplate than Django, faster MVP delivery

**Supabase Advantages:**
- üéØ **Instant Setup**: No local PostgreSQL installation needed
- üîê **Built-in Auth**: Ready for future user accounts and preferences
- ‚ö° **Real-time**: Can add live station updates with minimal code
- üåê **Hosted**: One less service to deploy and maintain
- üí∞ **Free Tier**: Perfect for MVP development and initial users
- üîç **PostGIS**: Built-in geographic queries for distance calculations

**Combined Benefits:**
- üì¶ **Single Deploy**: Only FastAPI app needs hosting, Supabase handles database
- üîß **Developer Experience**: Both have excellent Python integration
- üìà **Scalability**: Both scale automatically with usage
- üõ†Ô∏è **Tooling**: Great debugging and monitoring built-in
